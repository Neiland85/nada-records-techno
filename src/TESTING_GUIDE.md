# Video Hover Preview Testing Guide

## Overview
Your Nada Records techno store now includes an advanced video hover preview system that allows users to preview video content by simply hovering over track covers.

## How It Works

### 1. **Hover Detection System**
- **300ms delay** prevents accidental activations
- **Smooth transitions** between image and video states
- **Auto-pause** when cursor leaves the area
- **Volume control** at 60% for comfortable previewing

### 2. **Video Management**
- Videos are stored in key-value storage (`track-videos`)
- Each track can have one video associated with it
- Support for MP4, WebM, and OGV formats
- Fallback to cover image if video fails to load

### 3. **Visual Indicators**
- **"Hover for video"** badge appears on tracks with videos
- **"Video"** badge shows during preview playback
- **"Preview"** indicator displays during hover
- **BPM badge** remains visible in top-right corner

## Testing the System

### Quick Test Setup:
1. **Log in** to access the admin panel
2. Use the **"Video Test Panel"** to add sample videos
3. **Click "Agregar Videos de Prueba"** to add test videos to all tracks
4. **Hover over track covers** to see the preview in action

### Manual Testing Steps:
1. **Individual Track Testing:**
   - Use the "Video Upload Panel" for "Soy de Gestión"
   - Click "Demo URL" to load a test video
   - Add the video and test hover functionality

2. **Custom Video URLs:**
   - Add your own video URLs in the upload panels
   - Test with different video formats and lengths
   - Verify audio synchronization

## Sample Video URLs (for testing):
- `https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/ForBiggerEscapes.mp4`
- `https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/ForBiggerBlazes.mp4`
- `https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/ForBiggerJoyrides.mp4`

## Technical Features

### Performance Optimizations:
- **Lazy loading** of video content
- **Preload="none"** until hover activation
- **Memory cleanup** when videos are removed
- **Error handling** with graceful fallbacks

### Accessibility:
- **Keyboard navigation** support
- **Screen reader** friendly indicators
- **High contrast** mode compatibility
- **Reduced motion** respect for user preferences

### Browser Compatibility:
- **Chrome/Edge:** Full support including autoplay
- **Firefox:** Full support with user gesture requirement
- **Safari:** Full support with some autoplay restrictions
- **Mobile:** Touch-optimized with tap-to-play fallback

## Debugging Features

### Console Logging:
Open browser developer tools (F12) to see debug messages:
- `Hover preview starting for track: [Track Name]`
- `Video loading started for: [Track Name]`
- `Video ready to play: [Track Name]`
- `Hover preview stopped for: [Track Name]`

### Header Indicator:
- Shows count of tracks with videos configured
- Real-time updates as videos are added/removed
- Visual confirmation of system status

## Advanced Features

### Video Thumbnail Support:
- Optional custom thumbnails for better first impressions
- Automatic fallback to video first frame
- Support for external image URLs

### Format Flexibility:
- **MP4:** Best compatibility across all browsers
- **WebM:** High quality, smaller file sizes
- **OGV:** Open standard format support

### State Management:
- **Persistent storage** survives page refreshes
- **Real-time sync** across components
- **Cleanup handling** prevents memory leaks

## Production Recommendations

When deploying with your own content:

1. **Video Optimization:**
   - Duration: 15-30 seconds optimal
   - Resolution: 400x400px minimum (square format recommended)
   - Bitrate: 1-2 Mbps for web delivery
   - Format: MP4 H.264 for best compatibility

2. **Hosting Considerations:**
   - Use a CDN for global video delivery
   - Enable CORS headers for cross-origin videos
   - Implement video compression for faster loading
   - Consider adaptive bitrate streaming for longer clips

3. **User Experience:**
   - Test on various devices and connections
   - Monitor video load times and optimize accordingly
   - Consider providing preview thumbnails
   - Implement analytics to track engagement
