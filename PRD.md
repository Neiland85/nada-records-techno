## Design Direction

The design should evoke the raw energy of underground techno - dark, precise, and hypnotic with pulsing visual elements that respond to audio. Minimal interface approach serves the music, letting tracks and artwork dominate while maintaining professional credibility for serious collectors and DJs.

## Color Selection

Triadic color scheme (three equally spaced colors) creating dynamic contrast while maintaining the underground techno aesthetic with electric accents for interactive elements.

- **Primary Color**: Deep Charcoal (oklch(0.15 0.02 280)) - Underground foundation that lets music artwork pop
- **Secondary Colors**: Electric Blue (oklch(0.65 0.25 240)) for interactive elements and Warm Orange (oklch(0.70 0.15 60)) for purchase/premium actions
- **Accent Color**: Neon Cyan (oklch(0.80 0.20 200)) - High-energy highlight for play buttons and active states
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
  - Background (Deep Charcoal): White text (oklch(0.95 0 0)) - Ratio 12.8:1 ✓
  - Card (Darker Charcoal oklch(0.12 0.02 280)): Light Gray text (oklch(0.85 0.05 280)) - Ratio 9.2:1 ✓
  - Primary (Electric Blue): White text (oklch(0.95 0 0)) - Ratio 5.1:1 ✓

  - Accent (Neon Cyan): Dark text (oklch(0.15 0 0)) - Ratio 5.8:1 ✓

## Font Selection

Typography should convey precision and energy - clean sans-serif with strong geometric characteristics that complement techno's mathematical nature and electronic aesthetic.

- **Typographic Hierarchy**:
  - H1 (Store Title): Inter Bold/32px/tight letter spacing
  - H2 (Section Headers): Inter SemiBold/24px/normal letter spacing

  - Body (Descriptions): Inter Regular/16px/relaxed line height

## Animations

Subtle pulsing and waveform animations that sync with the techno aesthetic while maintaining functionality - movements should feel electronic and precise rather than organic.

- **Purposeful Meaning**: Subtle audio-reactive elements and loading states that mirror electronic music production interfaces
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Play buttons get primary animation focus, followed by waveforms, then subtle hover states on interactive elements
